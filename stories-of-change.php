                            <p class="mb-0">Rekha, a senior nurse in a private hospital in Nagpur, often witnessed
                                families go through difficult goodbyes. One day, after learning about <?php echo $ev_project_name; ?>
                                during a hospital orientation, she quietly pledged her own eyes.
                                Inspired, she started leaving pledge forms at the nurses’ station and softly mentioning
                                the concept to patient families in ICU waiting rooms - never pushing, just informing.
                                Within months, 40 staff members and even a few families had pledged.
                                “I realised awareness doesn’t need a stage. It needs sincerity.”
                                Rekha's simple, consistent effort planted seeds of vision - silently changing futures.

                            <p class="mb-0">Twelve-year-old Aarav heard about eye pledging during a science workshop.
                                Moved by the idea that he could help someone see the world, he took a pledge form home
                                and convinced his parents to pledge, too.
                                His school later hosted a small <?php echo $ev_project_name; ?> session, and Aarav, with his teacher’s
                                help, explained pledging during the morning assembly. Over 50 students carried forms
                                home that week.
                                “I may not be a doctor. But I think I still gave someone hope.”
                                Aarav proved that age has nothing to do with awareness - just intention.</p>

                            </div>

                            <p class="mb-0">Mrs. Nandita Shah, a retired librarian, decided to contribute to her
                                community library in a unique way. She printed 20 pledge forms from the <?php echo $ev_project_name; ?>
                                website and placed them in a neat folder beside the newspaper reading area with a simple
                                sign:
                                "Read. Reflect. Pledge."
                                Over the next few weeks, curious readers began asking questions. She answered with
                                patience, explaining that pledging doesn’t mean donating now - just expressing intent
                                for the future. Slowly, forms started to disappear.
                                “It’s just a corner in a library. But it’s full of quiet change.”
                                Sometimes, a gentle nudge in a calm setting is all it takes to open eyes - literally and
                                figuratively.

                            <p class="mb-0"><?php echo $ev_project_name; ?> volunteer Neeraj placed a small poster on the wall of a public
                                bus depot with a QR code linking to the pledge form and the line:

                                “Waiting for your bus? Take a moment to change a life.”
                                To his surprise, over 200 people scanned the code in the first week alone. Mechanics,
                                conductors, commuters - many were intrigued and pledged on the spot using their phones.
                                “I thought people wouldn’t stop and read. But they did.”
                                Even a busy place can become a space for change with the right message.
